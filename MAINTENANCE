Releasing new version
---------------------

Before release, it is usually worth the time to browse the Bugzilla
for patches and easy fixes.

1) Apply (merge) all changes you want to be present in the new version
   to the master branch.

2) Increment the version in the VERSION file (do not forget to commit)

3) run 'make upstream-release', which will
   - check if the version in VERSION does not exist already
   - create a tarball
   - upload the tarball to fedorahosted.org
   - tag the current commit with the version tag
   - push tags upstream

Note: we track bugs in Fedora / RH QA Process bugzilla for appropriate
      package, so fixing bugs in upstream release does not constitute
      an event for any bug status flipping.
